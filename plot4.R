### Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related
### sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

library(ggplot2)

# fetch all NEISCC records with Short.Name (SCC) coal
coalMatches  <- grepl("coal", NEISCC$Short.Name, ignore.case=TRUE)
coalMatchesNEISCC <- NEISCC[coalMatches, ]

aggregatedTotalByYear <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, coalMatchesNEISCC, sum)

g <- ggplot(aggregatedTotalByYear, aes(factor(year), Emissions))
g <- g + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab(expression('Total PM'[2.5]*" emissions")) +
  ggtitle('Total Emissions from coal: 1999-2008')
print(g)

### All but "point" sources saw a decrease in emissions from 1999 to 2008.
### In 1999, "point"was the lowest PM25 emissions source, by 2008,
### "point" rose to second highest, with "non-road" moving into the lowest PM25
### emissions source
